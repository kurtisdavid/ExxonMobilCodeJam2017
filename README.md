# LegalEntityExtraction
Repo containing the files worked on during ExxonMobil's Code Jam July 2017.

The goal of the project was to automate extraction of legal entity data from contracts between ExxonMobil and suppliers. 

In this there are two files:

**extract_text.py**
-------------------
python script that takes word documents containing contract data and creates corresponding text files to be used in the analysis.

**legal_entity_extraction.ipynb**
---------------------------------
Jupyter Notebook that outlines the steps we took to experiment with the idea and some results! You can view it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kurtisdavid/LegalEntityExtraction/blob/master/legal_entity_extraction.ipynb).
